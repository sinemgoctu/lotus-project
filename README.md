LOTUS 

This is front-end part of our TÜBİTAK approved graduation project with my friends. I was responsible from front-end side. 

The aim of this project is to support expectant mothers and new mothers to have a healthy pregnancy, birth and postpartum period through a web and mobile application that will be developed for their needs and to create positive effects on maternal and child health. In this regard, our goals are;

1-To create a platform for sharing experiences between expectant mothers and new mothers.

2-Creating a platform for sharing mother-baby products among those in need.

3-Providing users with doctor appointments and one-on-one consultations.

4-To help users have a healthy pregnancy, birth and postpartum period by providing personalized content.

5-Providing relaxation and support to users by offering special podcasts and music.
